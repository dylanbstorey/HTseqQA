FastQC
=======
Quality control for data generated by Illumina Sequencing. 

Why?
=======
We needed a scalable local solution for generating quality control reports in the 100k Genomes Project.
We started with these measurements and visualizations and will likely add more later.

Installation/Dependencies:
==========================
The program will need to have a c++11 compatible compiler. To visualize the graphs you'll need R and ggplot2. 

Usage:
=======

`./HTseqQA <options> -i <incoming file> `
`options available:`
`   -o <int>`
`       Phred offset for the file, optional `

The output is a text file with an extension of '.R' and run through R to get your graph out.

If you need to be running many files I suggest using parallel:

`parallel HTseqQA -i {} ::: /path/to/all/*.fastqs`

On a standard computer we're able to process 4000+ files over night.

TODO:
======
*Add flag and code for producing YAML dumps of the files.
*Sequence representation proportions and graphs.
